## Design
1. Thinking about our design methods and coordinating made the code implementation much more uniform and cohesive. I feel that all of our work reflects the group as a whole and not individual works pieced together because we made sure to have clear design methods.

2. The most difficult part of the design was deciding what information to provide the users. We clearly defined which commands we hoped to use with the bot, but there was ambiguity in the exact output the user should recieve. If given a chance to build this project again from the ground up I would lay a clearer framework for the types of responses a user can expect from a command, and give the user more control on the ranges/types of data that they recieve.

3. Use cases were very helpful for me because it created a many clear, managable goals. I work most efficiently when I have many small tasks that I can tackle rather than one large overarching goal.

## Implementation
1. Having several team members implementing, testing, and integrating helped to make the project feel like a working machine. Bugs that I would take a long time to find might get picked up by another team member and expedite the debugging process. 

2. The most difficult thing for me was ensuring everything was a uniform format. It is important to me that anyone working on or looking at our code implementation can clearly understand how it works. I believe that consistent naming conventions and space formatting are incredibly important for this. Unfortunately for me, this meant breaking old habbits to maintain conventions that others are used to. If I could change one thing, I would have had a discussion before any coding was done outlining the naming and spacing conventions we would all use throughout the project.

3. I have very rarely worked with others on code projects, and as such, I was not very familiar with github prior to working on our bot. I certainly plan to continue honing my skills on git and github because they are so powerful for collaborative projects.


## Process
1. Much like the use cases, the Kanban board made several small, easily achievable pieces of work that I could easily implement within a few minutes. The code review helped me feel more knowledgable about the entire scope of the project, and made me feel responsible for having well executed and well formatted code solutions.

2. Most difficult for me was routinely checking the Kanban board and code reviewing. I am most used to working by myself on projects, so being accountable for my work and reviewing others as part of a team was an adjustment.

3. After working on this project I feel that code reviews are super useful in making sure everyone on the project understands the system as a whole, keeps everyone accountable for their work, and catches issues before they become grander in scale. I hope to use code reviews in all future collaborative projects, and maybe even individual projects.

## Overall
The Kanban boards, for me at least, seem to boost productivity and help ensure individual tasks are completed. Code reviewing helped maintain accountability, ensured each member was knowledgeable about the project, and helped catch issues quickly. Our system of integration and testing helped to expedite our workflow and quickly debug issues. Together, these three facets of our implementation helped cover the necessary tasks of developing and maintaining the integrity of our project.
