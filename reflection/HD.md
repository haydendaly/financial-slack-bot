# Reflection
## Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

I think that allocating time to think about design methods improved not only our approach to the project but are understanding of it. There obviously exists room for improvement but I think that clearing this up at the beginning was helpful.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

Honestly, I think writing out the use cases was good for understanding our goals for the project but limited our creativity with it. We built exactly what we aimed for and didn't experiment with potential ideas. I would've negated the use cases in the design documentation if I were to build this project personally.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I think having a UML diagram of the architecture clearly defined was useful. Usually, I jump into projects and the architecture develops out of experimentation and usually ends up unorganized.

## Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

I think this portion was pretty standard but I think that defining a schema on how the functions and the Slack API interact was good for development practices and made parallel development easy.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I think I would've Dockerized the code so I could run the Slackbot locally with ease and have it be reproducible.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again on another project?

Really nothing in this project was super new to me, it was all pretty standard as I mentioned prior. I think that using the router to map strings to functions was useful because it constrained the schema to one interface with one format making integrating and testing the two components incredibly easy.

## Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing, Kanban and code review in your project?

I think using the pull requests for code review was super helpful because it ensured someone else looked at my code and were able to recommend changes.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I don't think we did Scrum 100% correctly. In repetition of this project, I would've clearly defined a timeline to ensure tasks are distributed over time.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I didn't know that GitHub has built in Kanban boards which i've already implemented onto another project and it's proved to be useful. I think it's nice that I don't have to use a different platform like Trello or Jira and can isolate the project to GitHub (i'm waiting till they have groupchats around projects next!).

## Overall

Not sure I understand this question entirely but I think some practices were very useful for this project (the Kanban board, code separation w/ clearly defined schema, and the code reviews) but some were unnecessary for a project of this scale and just seemed kind of pointless (sequence diagram between software components and user stories). I think the latter are very useful when you have a larger project that needs a clearly defined direction but loose value as you decrease the scale of the project to this size.
